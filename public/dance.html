    <h1>Historical Origins:</h1>
    <p>Bharatnatyam finds its origins in the "Natya Shastra," an ancient Indian treatise on performing arts attributed to Sage Bharata. Over centuries, this dance form evolved, gaining prominence in the temples where it served as a sacred art dedicated to

        themes, and poetic compositions. The dance is often accompanied by classical Carnatic music, featuring instruments like the mridangam, nattuvangam, flute, and veena.

        Tillana, each showcasing distinct aspects of the dance form, ranging from rhythmic complexities to emotional depth.
